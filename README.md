# E-Commerce Website

I will build a modern, responsive e-commerce website using **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**. The site will have a clean design with a **dark and light mode** feature, and it will work smoothly on all devices. Key features include a **landing page** with a pop-up modal, a **responsive navbar** with dropdowns, and animated scrolling effects.
